# transformers

Library used:
* Kotlin
* Koin for Dependecy injection.
* Room for local DB (Implementation Databbase, Entity, Dao not implemented yet).
* Retrofit to workk with HTTP API.
* Coroutines to handle different thread.

I din't use Materia Design as for the requirment to not use UI libraries.
